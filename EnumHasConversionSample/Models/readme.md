`WineType.tt` template is responsible for generating WineType model. Before running the template, run the application which checks to see if the database exists, if the database does not exists.

Create the `WineType` table using a model, [WineTypes](WineTypes.cs) as we can not create the WineType table via an emum. There are other methods to create the table and seed it, I wanted to keep this simple for this demonstration.
